# Phase 1 Complete: Foundation

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Set up initial project structure and dependencies
- Initialized Go module: `github.com/rshade/pulumi-flexera-cost`
- Created project directory structure:
  - `/provider/` - Provider implementation
  - `/provider/api/` - Flexera API client
  - `/cmd/pulumi-resource-flexera/` - Main entry point
  - `/examples/` - Usage examples (to be populated)
  - `/tests/` - Test files

### 2. ✅ Add core dependencies
- pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3 v3.169.0
- pulumi/pulumi/pkg/v3 v3.169.0
- go-resty/resty/v2 v2.16.5 (HTTP client)
- google.golang.org/grpc v1.67.1
- google.golang.org/protobuf v1.36.6

### 3. ✅ Create provider package structure with schema definitions
- Created stub provider implementation that compiles
- Defined API types for cost data structures
- Set up provider server interface

### 4. ✅ Implement Flexera API client with authentication
- Created `api.Client` with configurable settings
- Implemented caching mechanism with TTL
- Added request/response structures
- Created aggregation logic for cost data
- Added health check endpoint

### 5. ✅ Create CostResource type with CRUD operations
- Defined CostResource structure in provider
- Created stub implementations for all required methods
- Set up proper error handling

## Additional Accomplishments

### Build and Development Tools
- Created Makefile with commands:
  - `make build` - Build the provider
  - `make test` - Run tests
  - `make lint` - Run golangci-lint
  - `make fmt` - Format code
  - `make check` - Run all checks
  - `make clean` - Clean build artifacts

### Testing
- Created unit tests for API client (54.5% coverage)
- All tests passing
- Linting checks passing

### Documentation
- Updated README with basic usage instructions
- Created .gitignore for Go projects
- Added CLAUDE.md with detailed development guidelines

## Current Status

The foundation phase is complete with a working provider that:
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Passes all tests
- ✅ Passes linting checks
- ✅ Has proper project structure
- ✅ Has API client with caching
- ✅ Is ready for Phase 2 implementation

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Implement state introspection to collect resource IDs
2. Add cost data fetching and aggregation logic
3. Create provider configuration and initialization
4. Integrate with actual Flexera API endpoints
5. Add proper schema generation
